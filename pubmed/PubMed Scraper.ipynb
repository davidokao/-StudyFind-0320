      "Background Midazolam is commonly used preoperatively for anxiety. Adverse effects data in pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) is limited. Aims We hypothesized that preoperative midazolam increases the time to emergence from anesthesia and postoperative discharge. Secondary objectives assessed if patients receiving midazolam experienced increased side effects or complications from treatment. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing T&A from July 2014 to December 2015. Midazolam receiving patients (midazolam group: MG) were compared to patients who did not (non-midazolam group: NMG). Multivariable analyses were performed and adjusted for predefined potential cofounder variables. Results Emergence and discharge times were 5.2 minutes (95% CI [-7.1, 17.4]; p=0.41) and 10.1 minutes (95% CI [-6.7, 26.8]; p=0.24) longer in MG. These results were not statistically significant. Comparing by OSA status, there was no statistical difference in emergence and discharge times between mild, moderate and severe OSA groups or between MG and NMG within each OSA group. Emergence and discharge times in moderate OSA was 6.1 minutes (95% CI [-17.6, 29.8]; p=0.61) and 18.8 minutes (95% CI [-16.4, 53.9]; p=0.29) longer than mild OSA, and in the severe OSA group, 2.6 minutes (95% CI [-19.9, 25.1]; p=0.82) shorter and 2.8 minutes (95% CI [-30.3, 35.9]; p=0.87) longer. The incidence of postoperative complications was comparable between MG and NMG groups. Conclusions Premedication with midazolam was not associated with prolonged emergence or discharge time or higher incidence of complications after anesthesia for T&A in patients with OSA.\n",

      "Resistance to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been observed in both preclinical models and clinical studies. However, mechanisms of resistance to pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-conjugated ADCs have not been well characterized and thus, this study was designed to investigate development of resistance to PBD dimer warheads and PBD-conjugated ADCs. We established a PBD-resistant cell line, 361-PBDr, by treating human breast cancer MDA-MB-361 cells with gradually increasing concentrations of SG3199, the PBD dimer released from the PBD drug-linker tesirine. 361-PBDr cells were over 20-fold less sensitive to SG3199 compared with parental cells and were cross-resistant to other PBD warhead and ADCs conjugated with PBDs. Proteomic profiling revealed that downregulation of Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11), a putative DNA/RNA helicase, sensitizing cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents, was associated with PBD resistance. Confirmatory studies demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of SLFN11 in multiple tumor cell lines conferred reduced sensitivity to SG3199 and PBD-conjugated ADCs. Treatment with EPZ011989, an EZH2 inhibitor, derepressed SLFN11 expression in 361-PBDr and other SLFN11-deficient tumor cells, and increased sensitivity to PBD and PBD-conjugated ADCs, indicating that the suppression of SLFN11 expression is associated with histone methylation as reported. Moreover, we demonstrated that combining an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor, AZD6738, with SG3199 or PBD-based ADCs led to synergistic cytotoxicity in either resistant 361-PBDr cells or cells that SLFN11 was knocked down via siRNA. Collectively, these data provide insights into potential development of resistance to PBDs and PBD-conjugated ADCs, and more importantly, inform strategy development to overcome such resistance.\n",

      "Neuregulin protein 1 (NRG1) is a large (>â€‰60-amino-acid) natural peptide ligand for the ErbB protein family members HER3 and HER4. We developed an agonistic antibody modality, termed antibody ligand mimetics (ALM), by incorporating complex ligand agonists such as NRG1 into an antibody scaffold. We optimized the linker and ligand length to achieve native ligand activity in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and used a monomeric Fc-ligand fusion platform to steer the ligand specificity toward HER4-dominant agonism. With the help of selectivity engineering, these enhanced ALM molecules can provide an antibody scaffold with increased receptor specificity and the potential to greatly improve the pharmacokinetics, stability, and downstream developability profiles from the natural ligand approach. This ligand mimetic design and optimization approach can be expanded to apply to other cardiovascular disease targets and emerging therapeutic areas, providing differentiated drug molecules with increased specificity and extended half-life.\n",

      "Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) remains poorly defined, although it is applied to chronic neuropathic pain following surgical procedures of the breast, including mastectomy and lumpectomy in breast-conserving surgery. It is characterized by persistent pain affecting the anterior thorax, axilla, and/or medial upper arm following mastectomy or lumpectomy. Though the onset of pain is most likely to occur after surgery, there may also be a new onset of symptoms following adjuvant therapy, including chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n",
