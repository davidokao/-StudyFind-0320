Opioids are no longer touted as cure-all medications, and furthermore, there have been tremendous advances in alternative therapies such as in interventional pain, physical therapy, exercise, and nutritional counseling that have proven benefits to combat pain. The center for disease control now strongly recommends the use of multimodal analgesia and multidisciplinary approaches based on the individual needs of patients: personalized medicine. In this manuscript, the specifics of non-opioid pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesic approaches will be discussed as well as their possible indications and uses to reduce the need for excessive use of opioids for adequate pain control.'}, {'title': 'Long-acting antibody ligand mimetics for HER4-selective agonism.', 'publication date': '2020/10/14', 'pdf link': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74176-9', 'description': 'Neuregulin protein 1 (NRG1) is a large (>â€‰60-amino-acid) natural peptide ligand for the ErbB protein family members HER3 and HER4. We developed an agonistic antibody modality, termed antibody ligand mimetics (ALM), by incorporating complex ligand agonists such as NRG1 into an antibody scaffold. We optimized the linker and ligand length to achieve native ligand activity in HEK293 cells and cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and used a monomeric Fc-ligand fusion platform to steer the ligand specificity toward HER4-dominant agonism. With the help of selectivity engineering, these enhanced ALM molecules can provide an antibody scaffold with increased receptor specificity and the potential to greatly improve the pharmacokinetics, stability, and downstream developability profiles from the natural ligand approach. This ligand mimetic design and optimization approach can be expanded to apply to other cardiovascular disease targets and emerging therapeutic areas, providing differentiated drug molecules with increased specificity and extended half-life.'}, {'title': 'Human Relaxin-2 Fusion Protein Treatment Prevents and Reverses Isoproterenol-Induced Hypertrophy and Fibrosis in Mouse Heart.', 'publication date': '2019/12/17', 'pdf link': 'https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.119.013465', 'description': 'Background Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in Western countries, and there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. Relaxin-2 is a peptide hormone that mediates pleiotropic cardiovascular effects, including antifibrotic, angiogenic, vasodilatory, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. Methods and Results We developed RELAX10, a fusion protein composed of human relaxin-2 hormone and the Fc of a human antibody, to test the hypothesis that extended exposure of the relaxin-2 peptide could reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. RELAX10 demonstrated the same specificity and similar in\\xa0vitro activity as the relaxin-2 peptide. The terminal half-life of RELAX10 was 7\\xa0days in mouse and 3.75\\xa0days in rat after subcutaneous administration. We evaluated whether treatment with RELAX10 could prevent and reverse isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in mice. Isoproterenol administration in mice resulted in increased cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with vehicle. Coadministration with RELAX10 significantly attenuated the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with untreated animals. Isoproterenol administration significantly increased transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced fibrotic signaling, which was attenuated by RELAX10. We found that RELAX10 also significantly increased protein kinase B/endothelial NO synthase signaling and protein S-nitrosylation. In the reversal study, RELAX10-treated animals showed significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy and collagen levels. Conclusions These findings support a potential role for RELAX10 in the treatment of heart failure.'}]}\n"
